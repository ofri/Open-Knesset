Welcome to OpenKnesset's documentation!
=======================================

Open Knesset is an Open Source project for an online, open parliament.
OK started with a scraping script that crawls the ancient `official site`
and parses its data.  Next, a Django based web site was developed and released
in 2010.

The project has grown from a base of parliamentry data - votes, bill proposals and protocols -
to include user content - tags, comments, annotations
and agendas - and smart displays to simplify consumption.
